I have troubles, lots of troubles. 

I am behind my PSEG bills, Chase bills, tuition bills, resume writing, cover letters, University classes(which already cost me 3500$ to save my ass). They are all making me like a rat, making me like I am avoiding things.

But those ain't the real troubles; they are easy to be fixed, in a few days, one week, tops. The real problem is that I am avoiding fixing those, cause they look messy to me and I don't want to touch them. Which is contagious I might add, cause I am avoiding more and more.
